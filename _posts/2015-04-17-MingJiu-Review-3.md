In our third installment of reviews with MingJiu, we go over a game I played against a random person at the Montreal Go Club. This game was especially painfully for me to show MingJiu having not even realized a blunder.

MingJiu: Yes, but in this case, black is already strong on the top side , so white should play a little farther.]

;W[do]C[MingJiu: D5 is not the biggest move right now.

Jay: Really!?

MIngJiu: Yes, Q12 is is still weak, no a move at R6 is the biggest.

Jay: That's so simple, but I would have never thought of that in a game.]

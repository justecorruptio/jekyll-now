OK, after a ten-year hiatus, I'm gonna try my hand at blogging again.  Blog technology has come a long way since Xanga, but the hardest part is still getting yourself to sit down and write the damned things.  Makes you wonder how our forefathers had perseverance to quill in his paper diary by oil lamp every night.

This blog will be mainly me rambling about things that interest me like code golfing, or musings about life.  Hopefully you get nerd-sniped and maybe learn a thing or two.

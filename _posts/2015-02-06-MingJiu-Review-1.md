I'm going to try something new. I'm transcribing (from memory) a review by Jiang MingJiu 7P of one of my games. I visit his game review sessions semi-regularly, and learn quite a lot.  Hopefully, writting it down will help the points stick.

This game is between me and a 3 Dan on the Dragon Go Server. I've written the commentary as a dialogue between MingJiu and those in attendance.

Jay: Locally, is N4 or O5 better?

MingJiu: N4. O5 leaves too much weakness on the bottom.]

;B[oc]C[MingJiu: Black missed a chance. You should instead play O17 to try to get sente to play the large move at N11.

Jay: Oh wow, I didn't think of N11 it's so solid and simple. All I thought about was N10, but the cutting point is nasty.

MingJiu: That's you!]

The second installment of a review with MingJiu Jiang 7P. I should mention that I'm paraphrasing MingJiu's comments and toning down is lovable gruffness a bit.

This was a game I play in the 2015 Jujo. My opponent was black, later revealed to me that his last official rating was 5 Dan!

MingJiu: Your mistake at R5 made black more solid on the right. Otherwise, white is better because white is alive.]

Jay: Ok, the game gets really bad, let's stop here.])
